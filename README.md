# Baltimore Polytechnic guest class on labor economics
### John Green
### Johns Hopkins Economics
### Dec 2023

This repo contains materials for a 2023 guest lecture for Baltimore Polytechnic's AP Economics students. The rough outline will be:
1. Overview of labor economics
2. Work of Claudia Goldin
3. Working with data
4. Trade-offs in work decisions (more Goldin)

1,2, and 4 follow from the slides "polyecon_slides.pdf", while 3 will be a walk-through of the Jupyter notebook "polyecon_notebook.ipynb". The notebook can be downloaded and run locally (using requirements.txt) or it can be run virtually on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NH7f65Q2kQUtNeaf-sXADWCAISPKbmnh?usp=sharing), which is recommended for this lesson.

We will try and understand what labor economics studies, using the work of recent Nobel-winner Claudia Goldin as a guide, and then get our hands dirty with some actual data and code.
